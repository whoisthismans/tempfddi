						<p align="justify"> This presentation on systematic review examines the current state of research on the application of Artificial intelligence (AI) in the fashion and apparel industry. The review analyses a total of 65 peer reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2023, covering various aspects of AI applications in the fashion industry, including product design and development, supply chain management, customer experience and sustainability.  </p>
						<p align="justify"> The findings indicate that AI is being applied in various ways in the fashion industry, with potential benefits in improving efficiency, reducing waste and enhancing the customer experience. However, there are also concerns about the ethical implications of AI, such as data privacy, bias and transparency. The review identifies several gaps in the current research, including the need for more empirical studies and a focus on ethical considerations.  </p>
						<p align="justify"> The review concludes that AI has the potential to transform the fashion industry, but further research is needed to optimize its potential and ensure that its benefits are maximized while minimizing its risks. </p>

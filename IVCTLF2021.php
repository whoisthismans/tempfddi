							<h3 align="center"> Students & faculties of FDDI Hyderabad campus presents three research papers during ‘IVCTLF-2021’ organized by Wollo University, Ethiopia </h3></br>

						<p align="justify"> Three research papers were presented by the students & faculties of Footwear Design & Development Institute (FDDI), Hyderabad campus during the International Virtual Conference on Textile, Leather & Fashion (IVCTLF)-2021 which was held on 06th & 07th May 2021 at Kombolcha Institute of Technology, Wollo University Ethiopia. </p>
						<p align="justify"> Wollo University is one of the Federal Universities built among a group of 2nd generation Universities in Ethiopia. Being located in the South Wollo Zone of the Amhara State, the University is designed to be a center of learning and research in a wide range of fields to meet the growing demand of trained manpower of the country.</p>				
						<p align="justify"> The objective of the international conference was to provide a platform to discuss challenges, opportunities, innovations and applications in Leather & Fashion that will give people from academia and industry the opportunity to have exchange of ideas, exciting innovations and challenges in the rapidly emerging field.</p>
						<p align="justify"> During the two days virtual conference, a total of 17 research papers were shortlisted from various parts of the globe by IVCTLF-2021 Organizing Committee consisting of Dr. Melaku Tamene, Dr. Habtamu Mohammed, Dr. Assamen Ayalew, & Team and Dr. Sukumar, Dr. Aruna Sampath, conference facilitators from Wollo University, Ethiopia.</p>
						<p align="justify"> The students & faculties of FDDI School of Footwear Design and Production (FSFDP) of Hyderabad campus presented three research papers during the international virtual conference. </p>
						<p align="justify"> On 06th May 2021, Ms. Lakshmi Gayatri Pudipeddi, Design elective student of B.Des. FDP (2018-22) batch, under the guidance of Mr. Abdul Rahuman M., Jr. Faculty (FSFDP) presented her research paper on the topic “3D Printed Gyroid Lattice Structure as Midsole for Better Mechanical Properties”. </p>
												
						<span class="news-details-img">
						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/new@fddi/IVCTLF.JPG" alt="img">
						</span>
						
						<p align="justify"> The paper discusses about the idea of using Gyroid lattice structure as a midsole in footwear. Using 3D printing these cuticular structures can be produced easily in lightweight and having more strength. The lattice parameters of the structure can be altered to fit the function. These gyroid structures have photonic energy gaps which makes them a good optical nano structure. </p>
						<p align="justify"> On the same day, another research paper was presented by Mr. Poturi Chandra Shekar & Mr. Vooradi Prasanth, Production elective student of B.Des FDP (2018-22) batch under the guidance of Mr. Deepak Choudhary, H.O.D, (FSFDP) on the topic “Implementation of Lean Manufacturing into the Footwear Industries”. </p>
						
						<span class="news-details-img">
						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/new@fddi/IVCTLF1.JPG" alt="img">
						</span>
						
						<p align="justify"> The paper elucidates that the concept of lean manufacturing was developed for maximizing the resource utilization through minimization of waste. It also explains that for the successful implementation of lean manufacturing, the organisation had to focus on all the aspects such as Value Stream Mapping (VSM), Cellular Manufacturing (CM), U-line system, Line Balancing, Inventory control, Single Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED), Pull System, Kanban, Production Levelling etc. </p>
						<p align="justify"> The third research paper was presented on 07th May 2021 by Mr. Loganathan T., Jr. Faculty (FSFDP) on the topic of “Design and Development of Sustainable Glide Shoe in Biodegradability study in Compost Environment”. The paper focused on manufacturing a glide shoe which is completely made of organic and easily degradable materials without diminishing the quality of it. </p>

						<img class="img-responsive" src="img/new@fddi/IVCTLF2.JPG" alt="img">
						</span>
						
						<p align="justify"> The research papers were presented as new examples of creative possibilities in futuristic footwear design, development and sustainability & so on. </p>
						<p align="justify"> The audiences were all ears to listen to the experts valued inputs and all the research papers were appreciated by all. </p>
						<p align="justify"> The international virtual conference also provided an opportunity for participants to share and discuss their creative ideas for futuristic footwear design & development. The context of all research papers were based on new innovative research and ‘Industry 4.0’ which gives opportunity to develop futuristic leather and non- leather based sectors in India with global standards. </p>
						<p align="justify"> The research papers that were presented will be published in Abyssinia Journal of Engineering & Computing (Wollo University, Journal), Ethiopia.</p>

						<p align="justify"> Mr. Mubarak, Senior Sports Lead of Puma SE, vividly explained the details about different kind of shoes i.e. running shoes, sports shoes, lifestyle shoes and walking shoes. The students witnessed soles of different kinds and learnt about what each had to offer. Students were introduced to the lightest running shoe (weighing 147 gms.), with nitro sole and were told about its different aspects which made it the right choice for a runner. </p>
						<p align="justify"> In addition, the students visited various brands such as Nike, Adidas, Reebok, Skechers, Inc 5, Fila etc. for the comparative analysis of their design project. The Inc 5 store had the Birkenstock footwear made with cork foot bed, which amazed the students. </p>
						<p align="justify"> In other stores such as Adidas and Nike, students were exposed to various innovative technologies that were part of the footwear, such as 3D printed lattice sole, temperature ineffective shoes, air max technology and ultra-boost technology. </p>
						<p align="justify"> It was a tremendous learning experience for the students. </p>

						<p align="justify"> Mithila painting or Madhubani painting is a style of traditional painting practiced in the Mithila region of northern Bihar. This style of painting has been traditionally done by the women of the region, though today men are also involved in this unique art. These paintings are popular because of their tribal motifs.</p>

						<p align="justify"> The efforts will be made through this training center to revive, re-construct, and develop this beautiful art as a part of cottage industry and to persuade the unemployed youth/ migrant labour artisans engaged in this art to develop product for commercial purposes.</p>
						<p align="justify"> As a result of such training programme, this sector will soon create a separate platform and niche in the domestic and international markets and immense social and economic benefits will accrue for the artisans, which would result into the development of craft, culture & commerce.</p>

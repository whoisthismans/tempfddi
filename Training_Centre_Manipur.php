						<p align="justify">  Manipur is an important constituent of the ‘Seven-Sister States’ of our country and craft traditions of this State are profoundly entrenched. The people of Manipur are artistic and creative in their thinking and outlook. Every house possesses a loom, and Manipuris weave with a passion and style, unrivalled by any other State. Kauna, Cane and Bamboo small products of Manipur like coasters, pen stand, mats, mugs, bags etc. have a rich appeal to the customers and are a crowd puller in various tradeshows and expos. The value addition of these craft products using leather will be very beneficial in increasing the acceptability of these products and enhance its market value.  </p>

						<p align="justify"> FDDI organized a variety of events and activities about Mission Lifestyle for Awareness (LiFE), cumulating to World Environment Day on 5th June 2023.   </p>
						<p align="justify"> Mission Lifestyle for Environment recognizes that Indian culture and living traditions are inherently sustainable. The importance of conserving our precious natural resources and living in harmony with nature is emphasised in our ancient scriptures. The need of the hour is to tap into that ancient wisdom and spread the message to as many people as possible. Mission LiFE seeks to channel the efforts of individuals and communities into a global mass movement of positive behavioural change.  </p>

									<p align="justify"><strong> HOD’s Message </strong> Footwear companies in India, like many other sectors, are undergoing an unprecedented transformation. Businesses must, however, become familiar with the concepts developed by academic research and support for making Industry 4.0-ready in order to accomplish this. Digital integration of the end-to-end value chain has become a strategic priority for companies, and concepts like additive manufacturing, automation, robotics, and digital technology are no longer foreign concepts.   </p>
                                    <p align="justify">It will take some new thinking on product construction and automation to transform the upper part of the shoe from 2D to 3D. The stitching operation still has many cut parts, and removing all the handcrafted pieces is far from complete. However, companies have already begun exploring new ways to change the manufacturing landscape and technology that will allow for mass customization of footwear without adding additional costs to the process.</p>

                                    <p align="justify"> <strong> HoD’s Message</strong> The Indian retail industry is very vast and is considered to be a platform which has employment for all. Be it the educated, barely educated or the uneducated, the skilled or the unskilled, labours or managers, everyone can find some kind of employment in this industry. The reason for this endless employment opportunity is simple – the Indian retail industry has been on a continuous growth since its inception. With each passing day, a lot of retail space is being created, and along it brings employment opportunities.  However, it’s no longer as simple as just moving into a store, handing in your resume and walking out with a job. The complex nature of the retailing, entry of so many foreign brands into India and modern technology-led era have led to retailers seeking special requirements from candidates. The explosion of e-Commerce on the Indian retail sector too has necessitated hiring of trained retail professionals. </p>
									<p align="justify"> In FDDI, we provide our students techno-managerial learning as per the requirement of Industry and produce professionals like Visual Merchandisers, Store Managers, Merchandisers, Retail Operation Managers, Supply Chain Managers. Retail Sales Managers etc. </p>

                        <p align="justify">Dear Students and Industry Partners,</p>
                        <p align="justify"> Footwear Design and Development Institute (FDDI) which is having its twelve campuses across the country located at Noida, Fursatganj, Chennai, Kolkata, Rohtak, Chhindwara, Guna, Jodhpur, Ankleshwar, Banur, Patna and Hyderabad is improving the quality of education and leaving no stone unturned to achieve and surpass the expectations cast upon it as an ‘Institute of National Importance’. </p>
                        <p align="justify"> To make mark on the educational spectrum, FDDI is in the process of consolidating these campuses and establishing FDDI as a brand in the educational landscape. </p>
                        <p align="justify"> It has also developed strong competencies for promoting skill and knowledge in retail, fashion, and leather goods sectors. With India’s economy poised to grow at a significant rate for many years to come in future, these sectors, especially retail, will offer plenty of opportunities to graduating students. </p>
                        <p align="justify"> FDDI has established Centers of Excellences (CoEs) at some of the campuses. These CoEs have been provided with the facility specifically equipped for addressing a particular thematic area of specialisation and is having the best available infrastructure and skills to not only aid research and development, but, also address concerns of the industry like product development, technological assistance and centres for incubation and entrepreneurship development. </p>
						<p align="justify"> FDDI is intensively engaged in the work related to quality & certification through its International Testing Centre (ITC) located at Noida and Chennai having physical & chemical testing laboratories. These labs are equipped with state of art testing facilities where testing of leather products, footwear, footwear components, textile products and miscellaneous articles made up of plastics is carried out. Prominent brands such as Adidas, Reebok, Puma, Nike, Renault, Nissan, and IOCL have used our lab for testing their products. </p>
						<p align="justify"> It is awarded with prestigious certifications and accreditations such as SATRA Technology Center- UK, ISO 9001 and ISO 14000 Certification and Bureau of Indian Standard Certification. </p>
						<p align="justify"> Recently, we have restructured the Noida & Chennai labs with new advanced machines for improving testing and inspection in a transparent manner. </p>
						<p align="justify"> I take this opportunity to extend a cordial invitation to the industry representatives as well as students on campus to become a part of this journey. </p>
						
                        <p style="text-align:justify">Thank you for taking the time to read this message.</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify">Best regards,</p>

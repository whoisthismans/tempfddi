Through the presentation he gave clarity on understanding of IP, the value of intangible assets, why we need IP, the categories of IP and industrial design and a product with many IPs.  </p>
						<p align="justify"> Mr. Subhajit presented various examples of some famous companies like Nike, Crocs, Nokia, Greensole etc. and made the students realize that, when in future they would be thinking of commercializing their own design, then the foremost step would be to think about IP, otherwise the uniqueness of their design would vanish.  </p>
